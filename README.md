# ConvJoint
Convolutional neural network prediction of joint (adhesively bonded) strenght

https://github.com/egarhore/ConvJoint/releases

This program allows the user to visualise the adhesively bonded joints.

This joint is created based on the design variable which modifies the outer adherends.

The strength of the joint can be predicted using the trained convolutional neural network.

The actual strength of the joint can also be calculated using finite element analysis (ABAQUS).

The program includes a database accessible to the user which removes the requirement of performing finite element analysis using ABAQUS.

The user could also provide design variables outside of the database (provided an ABAQUS license is available to perform the analysis).
